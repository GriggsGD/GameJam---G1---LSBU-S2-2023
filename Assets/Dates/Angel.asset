      V\u2026 Video games, am I right?"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: Such forms of entertainment are frivolous.
    nResponse: Video games!
    bResponse: "You don\u2019t sound very interested."
  - dialog: "Satisfactory. I have engaged you successfully in \u2018conversation\u2019.
      Is your disgusting meat brain obsessed with me yet? "
    responsable: 1

    gResponse: "I am not strong enough to do so. You, however\u2026"
    nResponse: All the time.
    bResponse: What?
  - dialog: "God\u2019s gross. He leaves his stuff everywhere, he won\u2019t give
      us reign over our own form, he just sits on his sorry @*% all day and has us
      do all the dirty work. I think I deserve some time on the throne. "
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: That throne was made for you.
    nResponse: Sounds awful.
    bResponse: Hey, this reminds me of paradise lost. You should read it!
  - dialog: 'The power of gods is fueled by belief. If I am to grow in power, I must

      of Gabriel\u2019. Wonderful, no? "
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: All hail the mighty Gabriel!
    nResponse: It has a great ring to it!
    bResponse: Why not call it something more interesting?
  - dialog: "I\u2019m- I\u2019m not actually \u2018the\u2019 Gabriel. I\u2019m- I\u2019m
      a different one. It\u2019s hard to name so many angels and not have any repeats. "
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: "I\u2019m sure you\u2019re the better of the two!"
    nResponse: "That doesn\u2019t matter to me."
    bResponse: "I couldn\u2019t tell! You seem so similar! "
  - dialog: You, my disgusting meatbag friend, are a prime candidate to be my first
      follower. Will you throw away all previous needs, all previous beliefs, and
      devote your life to me?
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: It would be an honour to serve you.
    nResponse: "2 more dates and it\u2019s a deal"
    bResponse: "I\u2019m not doing that."
  - dialog: "Well then I believe our business is concluded here, I must find others
      to recruit to my new faith. I would like to go on another\u2026date\u2026with
      you."

    nResponse: Till our next meeting then
    bResponse: Maybe dial it back on the faith talk
