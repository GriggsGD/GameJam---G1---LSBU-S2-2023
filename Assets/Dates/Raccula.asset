  bio: "Hi\u2026Hello\u2026Greetings, I am Count Raccula from Trashalvania, you cannot
    see me in your mirrors even if I am there\u2026I am too good at hiding. Don\u2019t
    worry though I only come out at night.\r"
  occupation: Usually I am known for sucking people's blood however I have now decided
    that their trash is much more valuable so I will be accepting that instead but
    I expect 3x as much to compensate.

  notes: Close relative of NosFerretu, recently heard getting assaulted by some animals
    but he denies this ever happened and does not like it being brought up
  dialogs:
  - dialog: Before we begin can we dim the lights in here, this is too much for me.
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: Because you're a vampire right?
    nResponse: 'Do you want better lighting for the mood? '
    bResponse: 'I thought vampires only got hurt in sunlight. '
  - dialog: "That\u2019s exactly what I mean let\u2019s close the windows, don\u2019t
      I look better in this light?\r"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: 'You certainly look more like a vampire, very scary? '
    nResponse: "I don\u2019t mind, let's get this date started. "
    bResponse: 'It really brings out the dark circles around your eyes? '
  - dialog: "Wait really (I told you so) Shut up\u2026So err anyway how hungry are
      you right now?\r"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: Not particularly, you can have my plate if you want.
    nResponse: Why do you want to suck my blood?
    bResponse: "I\u2019m so starving I could eat a horse."
  - dialog: "Oh um well\u2026(say something)...I am no longer in the blood sucking
      business, trash is more valuable so I can eat any leftovers you may have."
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: "So that\u2019s why you live in Trashalvania."
    nResponse: 'It must be busy work dealing with all that trash. '
    bResponse: Am I hearing other voices?
  - dialog: "Yes my castle has a lot of spirits living in it who help me when it's
      appropriate, they are harmless and should stay quiet from here onwards (sorry).\r"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: Wow a castle, I love a gothic aesthetic. If you need help decorating
      let me know.
    nResponse: Ever thought of getting rid of the spirits?
    bResponse: A big castle like that probably needs sweeping, I will get my broom
  - dialog: "(What) No need\u2026I like my castle the way it is, what are you like
      with animals?\r\n"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: "If it\u2019s vampire bats you are asking about then I\u2019m for
      them all the way. "
    nResponse: "Oh I\u2019m a huge animal fan"
    bResponse: I love racoons.
  - dialog: "Glad we can agree on that, since I am a definitely vampire it would
      be odd if I didn\u2019t\r\n"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: I always wondered how vampires get dressed.
    nResponse: What type of bat can you turn into?
    bResponse: "Are you sure you\u2019re a vampire?"
  - dialog: "Well I can\u2019t see my reflection so hopefully that answers your question"
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: "This has been a great date\u2026"
    nResponse: Alright I need to know something
    bResponse: Something seems off here
  - dialog: "What\u2019s with that face you look like you want to say something."
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: I think I might be falling for you?
    nResponse: Why trash of all things?
    bResponse: Are you secretly 3 racoons in a costume?
  - dialog: "Wow would you look at the time it\u2019s almost dawn I must be going
      but we should do this again at a better time anyway have fun bye."
    responsable: 1
    gResponse: "I\u2019ll cover the bill"
    nResponse: 'See you soon '
    bResponse: Hey wait you stole my food!
